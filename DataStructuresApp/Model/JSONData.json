The variables are reserved in Last In First Out (LIFO) order - the last stored block of memory is the first to be freed. <font color=\"gray\" strokeColor=\"gray\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\nMemory Heap: <font color=\"black\" strokeColor=\"black\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n•stores variables in dynamic memory and access variables a bit slower. Variables stored in heap can be accessed randomly at any time. Memory in the heap is limited by virtual memory - it is often used when the data at runtime is not known. <font color=\"blue\" strokeColor=\"blue\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n\nWhere are pointers stored in memory? <font color=\"black\" strokeColor=\"black\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n•Pointers are always stored in the stack. The data created using the “new” expression are always stored in the heap, whereas the data that pointers referencing an existing variable are stored in the stack. <font color=\"blue\" strokeColor=\"blue\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n\nDelete the pointer in stack or heap? <font color=\"black\" strokeColor=\"black\" face=\"American Typewriter\">\n•You cannot delete a pointer stored in stack; however, you MUST delete a pointer whose data is stored in the heap. It is also good practice to set the memory of the pointer to NULL after deleting.",
